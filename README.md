Personal Webpage Driven by Data
=======

A data-driven website for an academic portfolio that includes publications, news, and travels, although it can be adapted for other personal portfolio websites. 

## How it works
The webpage is driven by personal data from Google spreadsheets exported to online CSV files (`people`, `news`, `courses`, `travels`, `publications`). These spreadsheets can be created and updated using Google Forms, further facilitating the data input process.

Please take a look at the [main Javascript file](https://github.com/namwkim/namwkim.github.io/blob/master/assets/js/homepage.js) for details.

If you are interested in using this website for your own personal webpage and need help or have questions, please let me know (email: nam.wook.kim@bc.edu).
